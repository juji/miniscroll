miniscroll
=========

A minimalist scroll plugin for jQuery.


Why?

- You can style it
- Automatic resize
- Simple API
- It's easy
- It won't do anything on mobile devices (why would you want it anyway?)

Why not?
- It only works on vertical-scrolls
- Modern Browsers only: css3 transitions, opacity, rgba colors
(but, you can style it)
